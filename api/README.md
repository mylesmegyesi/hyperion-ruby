Hyperion [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby)
=============

<em>1 API, multiple database backends.</em>

Hyperion provides you with a simple API for data persistence allowing you to delay the choice of database without delaying your development.

There are a few guiding principles for Hyperion.

 1. key/value store.  All Hyperion implementations, even for relational databases, conform to the simple key/value store API.
 2. values are maps.  Every 'value' the goes in or out of a Hyperion datastore is a hash.
 3. :key and :kind.  Every 'value' must have a :kind entry; a short string like "user" or "product".  Persisted 'value's will have a :key entry; strings generated by the datastore.
 4. Search with data.  All searches are described by data.  See find_by_kind below.

Hyperion Implementations:

 * [memory](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby/blob/master/api/lib/hyperion/memory.rb) - an in-memory datastore, ideal for testing, included in the hyperion-api gem
 * [mysql](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby/tree/master/mysql) - [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)
 * [postgres](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby/tree/master/postgres) - [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
 * [sqlite](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby/tree/master/sqlite) - [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)
 * [riak](https://github.com/mylesmegyesi/hyperion-ruby/tree/master/riak) - [Riak](http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/)

## Installation

To use just the in-memory datastore...

``` ruby
gem 'hyperion-api'
```

To use a specific implementation...

``` ruby
gem 'hyperion-postgres'
# or
gem 'hyperion-mysql'
# or
gem 'hyperion-sqlite'
```

## Usage

### Instantiating datastores

Hyperion provides a convenient factory function for instantiating any datastore implementation

``` ruby
require 'hyperion'
Hyperion.new_datastore(:memory)
Hyperion.new_datastore(:mysql)
Hyperion.new_datastore(:postgres, options)
Hyperion.new_datastore(:sqlite, options)
```

This will require the file "hyperion/\<impl\>" and instantiate the class Hyperion::\<impl camelcased\>

Each implementation must accept a hash of options in it's initializer

``` ruby
module Hyperion
  class Memory
    def initialize(opts={})
    end
  end
end
```

### Installing a datastore

Before you can use the Hyperion API, you must tell Hyperion which backend datastore you would like to use. There a couple of ways to go about this.

#### With elegence

This installs the datastore thread locally, and only within the given block.

``` ruby
# datastore not installed
Hyperion.with_datastore(:postgres, options) do
  # datastore is installed
  # some persistence code here
end
# datastore not installed
```

This method is useful for applications that have control of the main thread, such as webapps. The call to with_datastore can be placed inside of a middleware, such that the datastore is installed at the beginning of the request and uninstalled after the request. For example, this is a Rack middleware which instantiates a postgres datastore, opens a pooled connection, starts a transaction and calls the next middleware.

``` ruby
require 'hyperion'
require 'hyperion/sql'

class DatastoreMiddleware

  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end

  def call(env)
    connection_url = 'postgres://cspvswmv:bwTTUFRBRgnb@ec2-23-23-234-187.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d1uh0jkh0n8j3l'
    Hyperion.with_datastore(:postgres, :connection_url => connection_url) do
      Hyperion::Sql.with_connection(connection_url) do
        Hyperion::Sql.transaction do
          @app.call(env)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Each of these calls could, of course, be their own separate middlewares.

#### With brute force

This installs the datastore across all threads.

``` ruby
Hyperion.datastore = Hyperion.new_datastore(:postgres, options)
```

To uninstall

``` ruby
Hyperion.datastore = nil
```

This method is useful for when you do not have control of the main thread, such as desktop GUI applications. If you can bind the datastore once at high level in your application, that's ideal.  Otherwise use the brute force technique.

### Saving a value:

``` ruby
Hyperion.save({:kind => :foo}) #=> {:kind=>"foo", :key=>"<generated key>"}
Hyperion.save({:kind => :foo}, :value => :bar) #=> {:kind=>"foo", :value=>:bar, :key=>"<generated key>"}
```

### Updating a value:

``` ruby
record = Hyperion.save({:kind => :foo, :name => 'Sam'})
Hyperion.save(record, :name => 'John') #=> {:kind=>"foo", :name=>'John', :key=>"<generated key>"}
```

### Loading a value:

``` ruby
# if you have a key...
Hyperion.find_by_key(my_key)

# otherwise
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog) # returns all records with :kind of \"dog\"
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :filters => [[:name, '=', "Fido"]]) # returns all dogs whos name is Fido
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :filters => [[:age, '>', 2], [:age, '<', 5]]) # returns all dogs between the age of 2 and 5 (exclusive)
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :sorts => [[:name, :asc]]) # returns all dogs in alphebetical order of their name
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :sorts => [[:age, :desc], [:name, :asc]]) # returns all dogs ordered from oldest to youngest, and gos of the same age ordered by name
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :limit => 10) # returns upto 10 dogs in undefined order
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :sorts => [[:name, :asc]], :limit => 10) # returns upto the first 10 dogs in alphebetical order of their name
Hyperion.find_by_kind(:dog, :sorts => [[:name, :asc]], :limit => 10, :offset => 10) # returns the second set of 10 dogs in alphebetical order of their name
```

Filter operations and acceptable syntax:

    "=" "eq"
    "<" "lt"
    "<=" "lte"
    ">" "gt"
    ">=" "gte"
    "!=" "not"
    "contains?" "contains" "in?" "in"

Sort orders and acceptable syntax:

    :asc "asc" :ascending "ascending"
    :desc "desc" :descending "descending"

### Deleting a value:

``` ruby
# if you have a key...
Hyperion.delete_by_key(my_key)

# otherwise
Hyperion.delete_by_kind(:dog) # deletes all records with :kind of "dog"
Hyperion.delete_by_kind(:dog, :filters => [[:name, "=", "Fido"]]) # deletes all dogs whos name is Fido
Hyperion.delete_by_kind(:dog, :filters => [[:age, ">", 2], [:age, "<", 5]]) # deletes all dogs between the age of 2 and 5 (exclusive)
```

### Entities

An entity is, in essence, configuration. By defining an entity, you are telling Hyperion how to save ('pack') and load ('unpack') a specific kind. Defining entites is not required or nessecary in some cases. Hyperion will work just fine without them. However, they offer some very clear advantages.

#### Whitelisting

Only fields defined in the entity are allowed into the datastore.

``` ruby
Hyperion.defentity(:whitelisted) do |kind|
  kind.field(:age)
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :whitelisted, age: 23, hair_color: 'brown')
#=> {:kind=>"whitelisted", :key=><generated_key>, :age=>23}
```

#### Defaults

Default values can be assigned to fields.

``` ruby
Hyperion.defentity(:defaulted) do |kind|
  kind.field(:name)
  kind.field(:age, :default => 25)
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :defaulted, name: 'Myles')
#=> {:kind=>"whitelisted", :key=><generated_key>, :name=>"Myles", :age=>25}
```

#### Packers

Packers tell Hyperion how to treat certain fields when they are being saved.

``` ruby
Hyperion.defentity(:packed) do |kind|
  kind.field(:age, :packer => lambda {|value| value.to_i})
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :packed, age: '25')
#=> {:kind=>"packed", :key=><generated_key>, :age=>25}
```
A packer must be callable, i.e. respond to 'call'. The current value of a field will be passed to the packer, and the packer returns a potentially transformed value.

#### Unpackers

Unpackers tell Hyperion how to treat certain fields when they are being loaded.

``` ruby
Hyperion.defentity(:unpacked) do |kind|
  kind.field(:age, :packer => lambda {|age| age.to_i}, :unpacker => lambda {|age| age.to_s})
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :unpacked, age: '25')
#=> {:kind=>"unpacked", :key=><generated_key>, :age=>"25"}
```
An unpacker must be callable, i.e. respond to 'call'. The current value of a field will be passed to the unpacker, and the unpacker returns a potentially transformed value.

#### Types

Types are an easy way to share packers and unpackers between fields.

``` ruby
def to_int(value)
  if value
    value.to_i
  end
end

def to_str(value)
  if value
    value.to_s
  end
end

Hyperion.pack(Integer) {|value| to_int(value)}
Hyperion.unpack(Integer) {|value| to_int(value)}
Hyperion.pack(String) {|value| to_str(value)}
Hyperion.unpack(String) {|value| to_str(value)}

Hyperion.defentity(:typed) do |kind|
  kind.field(:age, :type => Integer)
  kind.field(:name, :type => String)
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :typed, age: '25', name: :a_symbol)
 => {:kind=>"typed", :key=><generated_key>, :age=>25, :name=>"a_symbol"}
```

If a type is specified as well as a custom packer or unpacker, the custom packer has priority.

``` ruby
Hyperion.defentity(:typed_2) do |kind|
  kind.field(:age, :type => Integer, :packer => lambda {|value| 2})
end

Hyperion.save(kind: :typed_2, age: '25')
#=> {:kind=>"typed_2", :key=><generated_key>, :age=>2}
```
